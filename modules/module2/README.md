# **Module 2**: Descriptive Statistics

Module 2 aims at familiarizing you with descriptive statistics, when the use them, and how to find them in both `Python` and `R`. Along with the data manipulation concepts of module 1, descriptive statistics is a major component to exploring and understanding your data.

## For Deployment
The following files and directories (and their contents) need to be deployed to Jupyter Hub for students. All other contents in the directory are **development only** and should **not** be deployed.

If we are deploying the module in sections based off of schedule, each file/directory has the "*Deployed By*" day assigned to it.

Path: `~/modules/module2/`

file/directory | Deployed By:
---------------|-------------
`module2.ipynb`| Monday
`images/`      | Monday        
`labs/`        | Monday
`practices/`   | Monday
`exercises/`   | Monday

The following is the entire contents of the directory. This directory is housed at the `MUDSA/DSAIntro` repository.
