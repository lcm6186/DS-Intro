# **Module 3**: Data Carpentry and Introduction to Databases

Module 3 introduces the vital step of data carpentry to your data science pipeline. After acquiring data, data carpentry is the first step that you take in order to prepare your data for analysis or to load into a database. Therefore, we will also touch on the topic of database loading and querying in this module.

## For Deployment
The following files and directories (and their contents) need to be deployed to Jupyter Hub for students. All other contents in the directory are **development only** and should **not** be deployed.

If we are deploying the module in sections based off of schedule, each file/directory has the "*Deployed By*" day assigned to it.

Path: `~/datasets/messy_survey.xls`

**This is a new dataset to the `datasets` directory and therefore will need to be deployed.**


Path: `~/modules/module3/`

file/directory                           |Deployed By:
